# Programming Challenge

##Instructions
Create a page on which letter O moves from left-middle to top-middle to right-middle to bottom-middle
and center every second in a cycle.


Make sure it works with different screen sizes on different devices.
Keep your code clean, simple and readable.

After completing the above, if you'd like to go above beyond:

	a- Persist the location of the O on server side, so that if the page is refreshed, the O starts
	   from where it was last time

	b- After each cycle add another letter O to the string, so at S5 you would show OO instead of O,
	   and at S10 you would show OOO and so on

	c- Instead of the 5 spots specified in the problem (left-middle, top-middle, etc...), move the O
	   between the 12 spots on an analog clock
